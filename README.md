# Hello Everyone!

I am a hobbyist coder currently working on a couple of projects, primarily involving **Telegram bots**. In addition, I develop **websites** and **Discord bots** that integrate with databases.

I speak **three languages**â€”English, German, and Russianâ€”and Iâ€™d love to connect if you have an interesting idea that I can help bring to life!
